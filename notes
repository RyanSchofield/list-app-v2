group components will take the parsed itemsJSON (should be an array of objects) as an input. 
groups will have title (string) and collapsed (boolean) attributes.
groups wil list the items (item.value is string, item.flagged is a boolean) with *ngFor.
logic for adding/removing/flagging items, or collapsing group will be on group component.
	don't worry about deleting group for now.
on change, an event will be emitted.
list component will listen for this event and update firestore. 
	id should be an attribute on group component to update correct document?
	alternatively, groups could be passed their corresponding document ref?

actually, this is what we will do:
	pass a docRef to each group
	group component will get the items collection on each group doc
	items collection will be listed.

<div class="groups">
  <div class="group" *ngFor="let group of groups;">
    <app-group></app-group>
  </div>
</div>
